"**Great Stuff** - If you write continuous posts under the same category, this app is a godsend. It allows you to switch between posts of the same category.

Very great plugin for writing novels chapter by chapter" - [eugenelim88](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-stuff-223/')

"**A simple and elegant solution** - A simple and elegant way for viewers to “flip” through your site’s posts chronically, as if they are successive pages in a magazine. The Floating Links plug-in solved a huge problem for me — I have lots of old content (nearly 1,000 posts spanning several years) — some of which is still relevant — that people couldn’t easily browse. Now they can. Thank you!" - [mfmfuller](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-simple-and-elegant-solution/')
